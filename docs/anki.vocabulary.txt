What is authentication in cryptography?|Proving identity - confirming that a party is who they claim to be.<br><br>Example: Alice proves she has the private key matching her public key
What is encryption?|Transforming plaintext into ciphertext so only authorized parties can read it.<br><br>Example: Converting "Hello" → "8x!2aQ" using a secret key
What is confidentiality in cryptography?|Ensuring data can only be read by intended recipients (achieved via encryption).<br><br>Example: Your message is encrypted so eavesdroppers can't read it
What is integrity in cryptography?|Ensuring data hasn't been modified or tampered with.<br><br>Example: Detecting if "Transfer $10" was changed to "Transfer $1000"
What is forward secrecy?|Past sessions remain secure even if long-term keys are compromised later.<br><br>Example: If your private key leaks today, yesterday's encrypted messages remain unreadable
What is replay protection?|Preventing attackers from capturing and re-sending valid messages.<br><br>Example: Stopping someone from recording "unlock door" and replaying it later
What is a symmetric key?|Same key used for encryption and decryption. Fast but requires secure key sharing.<br><br>Example: AES, ChaCha20 - both parties must have the same secret key
What is asymmetric key cryptography (public key cryptography)?|Key pair: public key (shareable) and private key (secret).<br><br>Example: Curve25519 - encrypt with public key, decrypt with private key
What is a hash function in cryptography?|One-way function that produces fixed-size output (digest) from any input.<br><br>Properties: deterministic, irreversible, collision-resistant.<br><br>Example: BLAKE2s - same input always gives same hash, can't reverse it
What is a MAC (Message Authentication Code)?|A tag that proves message authenticity and integrity using a shared secret.<br><br>Example: HMAC - verifies message came from someone who knows the secret key
What is AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)?|Combines encryption + authentication in one operation.<br><br>Example: ChaCha20-Poly1305 - encrypts data AND proves it hasn't been tampered with
What is a KDF (Key Derivation Function)?|Transforms secret material into one or more cryptographic keys.<br><br>Example: HKDF - takes DH result and derives separate encryption keys
What is DH (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange)?|Protocol for two parties to agree on a shared secret over public channel.<br><br>Example: Alice and Bob derive same secret without ever sending it
What is a nonce (Number Used Once)?|A value that must never repeat with the same key. Ensures uniqueness.<br><br>Example: Counter incremented for each message: 0, 1, 2, 3...
What is an ephemeral key in WireGuard?|Temporary key used for one session, then deleted (provides forward secrecy).<br><br>Example: Generated fresh for each handshake, never stored
What is a static key in WireGuard?|Long-term key that identifies a peer (like your identity).<br><br>Example: Your WireGuard private/public key pair in the config
What is a session key / transport key in WireGuard?|Short-lived keys derived from handshake, used to encrypt data packets.<br><br>Example: After handshake completes, these encrypt your actual traffic
What is the chaining key in WireGuard?|Running accumulator of all secrets during handshake (internal state).<br><br>Example: Continuously updated as each DH operation adds new secret material
What is the hash transcript in WireGuard?|Running hash of all messages exchanged (tamper-evident log).<br><br>Example: Records every public key and ciphertext sent/received
What is the initiator in WireGuard?|The peer who starts the handshake (sends message 1)
What is the responder in WireGuard?|The peer who receives the handshake and responds (sends message 2)
What is the difference between confidentiality and encryption?|<b>Encryption</b> is the technique/mechanism - the process of transforming plaintext to ciphertext.<br><b>Confidentiality</b> is the security property/goal achieved by using encryption.<br><br>Encryption is HOW, confidentiality is WHY
What is the difference between integrity and authentication?|<b>Integrity</b>: Ensures data hasn't been modified (detects tampering)<br><b>Authentication</b>: Proves the identity of a party (who sent it)<br><br>Example: MAC provides both - proves message wasn't changed AND came from someone with the secret key
What is the difference between MAC and AEAD?|<b>MAC</b>: Only provides authentication and integrity (no encryption)<br><b>AEAD</b>: Provides encryption + authentication + integrity in one operation<br><br>AEAD = Encryption + MAC combined efficiently
What is the difference between ephemeral and static keys?|<b>Ephemeral key</b>: Temporary, used once, then deleted (forward secrecy)<br><b>Static key</b>: Long-term, permanent identity key<br><br>WireGuard uses both: static for authentication, ephemeral for forward secrecy
What is the difference between chaining key and hash transcript?|<b>Chaining key</b>: Accumulates secrets (DH results), used for key derivation<br><b>Hash transcript</b>: Records all messages (public + encrypted data), used for authentication<br><br>Chaining key = secret material, Hash transcript = tamper-evident log
Why must a nonce never repeat with the same key?|Nonce reuse with the same key catastrophically breaks encryption security:<br>- Leaks keystream in stream ciphers<br>- Allows attackers to decrypt messages<br>- Enables forgery of authenticated data<br><br>This is why each message must use a unique nonce
How do the cryptographic building blocks work together in WireGuard?|<code>DH creates shared secret<br>  ↓<br>KDF derives keys from secret<br>  ↓<br>AEAD encrypts with derived keys<br>  ↓<br>Hash transcript proves no tampering<br>  ↓<br>Result: Authenticated, encrypted, forward-secret session</code>
What three properties does a cryptographic hash function have?|1. <b>Deterministic</b>: Same input always produces same hash<br>2. <b>Irreversible</b>: Can't recover input from hash (one-way)<br>3. <b>Collision-resistant</b>: Extremely hard to find two inputs with same hash
What is the purpose of forward secrecy?|To ensure that compromise of long-term keys (like your static private key) doesn't allow decryption of past session traffic.<br><br>Achieved by using ephemeral keys that are deleted after each session
What does "associated data" mean in AEAD?|Data that is authenticated but NOT encrypted. It's additional context bound to the ciphertext.<br><br>Example: In WireGuard handshake, the hash transcript is used as associated data - it's authenticated to prevent tampering but not encrypted since it's already public
