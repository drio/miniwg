# MiniWG: Educational WireGuard Implementation

A minimal, educational WireGuard implementation for learning cryptography and
networking protocols.

**Warning:** This is an educational implementation. Use official WireGuard for production.

## Overview

WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol that uses state-of-the-art cryptography.
This implementation focuses on clarity and learning rather than performance or
feature completeness.
